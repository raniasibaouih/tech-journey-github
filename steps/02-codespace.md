# Step 2: Launch a Codespace

**Previous step:** [Step 1 - Fork the Repo](01-fork.md)
**Next step:** [Step 3 - Set Up GitHub Copilot](03-copilot.md)

## You Have a Copy — Now You Need a Workshop

In Step 1 you forked the repo, so you own a copy of the files. Now you need a place to actually *work* on them. That place is a **Codespace**: a full development environment that GitHub runs for you in the cloud and opens right in your browser.

No installing anything. No setup on your own computer. You click a button and a real developer machine appears in a browser tab.

## What Is a Codespace?

A Codespace is **Visual Studio Code** — the editor millions of professional developers use — running on a real computer in the cloud. Because it is a real computer, it can:

- Edit and create files
- Run a real **terminal** (command line)
- Run code (Python, JavaScript, and more)
- Install extensions — including **GitHub Copilot**, the AI assistant you will set up in Step 3

> GitHub also has a lighter-weight editor called **github.dev** (you open it by pressing `.` on a repo). It is handy for quick edits, but it *cannot run code or use Copilot*. This course uses a Codespace so you get the full experience.

---

## Is It Free?

Yes. Personal GitHub accounts get a **generous free monthly allowance** for Codespaces (at the time of writing, 120 core-hours and 15 GB of storage per month — far more than this course needs). You will not be charged as long as you stay within it.

Two habits keep you safely inside the free allowance:
- **Stop your Codespace when you finish** (see the bottom of this page).
- **Do not leave many Codespaces running** at once.

---

## Your Task: Create a Codespace

1. Go to your forked repository on **github.com** (the page with *your* username in the address bar).
2. Click the green **`< > Code`** button near the top-right.
3. In the dropdown, click the **Codespaces** tab.
4. Click **Create codespace on main**.

GitHub now builds your cloud computer. The first time takes a minute or two — you will see a screen with build logs. When it finishes, a full VS Code editor opens in your browser.

> You are creating this Codespace on the `main` branch for now. That is fine — in Step 4 you will create your own branch from right inside the Codespace.

## Getting to Know Your Codespace

Once it loads, you will see:

- **Left sidebar** — the file explorer. Click any file to open it.
- **Main area** — the editor where you read and write files.
- **A terminal at the bottom** — this is a real command line. If you do not see it, open it from the menu: **Terminal → New Terminal** (or press `` Ctrl+` ``).
- **Bottom-left corner** — shows your current branch name (`main` for now).

Try the terminal out. Click into it, type the command below, and press Enter:

```bash
git status
```

You just ran a real git command on a real machine in the cloud. This is the exact workflow professional developers use every day.

---

## How to Know You Did It

- The browser tab shows your repo name and the word **Codespaces**.
- There is a working **terminal** at the bottom that responds to commands.
- The file explorer on the left shows the repo files, including the `exercises` and `steps` folders.

## Important: Stop Your Codespace When You Are Done

Your Codespace uses your free hours while it is running. When you finish a work session, **stop it** so you do not waste your allowance:

1. Go to **[github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces)**.
2. Find your Codespace in the list.
3. Click the **`...`** menu next to it and choose **Stop codespace**.

A stopped Codespace keeps all your files and picks up right where you left off next time — it just stops the clock. Codespaces also stop themselves automatically after about 30 minutes of inactivity, so you are protected even if you forget.

> **For today, do not worry about this.** This is only a ~3-hour course and you are nowhere near the free limit, so leave your Codespace running for the whole session. Just keep this habit in mind for the future, when you work on longer projects across many days.

> **Do not delete your Codespace until your work is committed and pushed** (Step 6). Stopping is safe; deleting an uncommitted Codespace loses your work.
